Homework 5: Work Day Scheduler
-----
This application was created to allow the user to create a schedule of events for daily business hours. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, in conjunction with the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

-----
## Description

This app will display normal business hours (9am - 5pm) and allow the user to input an itinerary of events, save them to local storage, and access the schedule even after refreshing the page. 

The background of the hourly rows will change as the day continues to represent hours in the past, the present hour, and future hours.
